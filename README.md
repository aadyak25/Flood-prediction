# Flood Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository explores a basic machine learning approach for flood prediction using rainfall-based features.

I forked this project to understand how classical machine learning classification models can be applied to environmental risk prediction. I reviewed the data preprocessing steps, feature selection, and model training workflow, and executed the notebook to study model behavior.

This work complements my academic research in climate data processing (CORDEX), hydrodynamic modelling, and GIS-based flood risk assessment.
